# SensorViz


This repository presents an analysis of the signals coming from the sensors that record the weight and strain measurements over the slabs built for a railway system. We use topological data analysis to identify the events where a two or three axle lorry passes to assess the structural integrity of the rails. Moreover, we derive the correlations between the sensor data obtained from the different locations in the railway to determine any changes that may be necessary for the rail-sensor system design.
